SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that existing code should be able to be extended without changing its source code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of having one large interface, it's better to have smaller, more specific interfaces tailored to the needs of the clients.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions. This principle helps to decouple classes and modules, making them easier to maintain and test.

These principles provide guidelines for designing classes and systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend, ultimately leading to better software quality and flexibility.
